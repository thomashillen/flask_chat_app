## 1.0 Introduction

We wanted to create an online chat application that would help support the classroom environment. For now, our application is targeted to Professors and Students in the NYU global network, but would ideally be used as a framework for other schools around the world. It allows professors to have a group chat with all of the students enrolled in the class, and enables student-student or student-professor private messaging who don't necessarily want to add eachother as a "friend" on social media platforms.

### 1.1 Purpose

This project was created as a final project for our Computer Networking Class. The reason we created this application is that there are many schools and universities around the world that donâ€™t have sophisticated systems for communication between students and professors that are participating in a class (ex. Using facebook group chats, emails, and zoom only).
Today, the main means for communication between a student and a professors is email, and students communicate with eachother using social media. Back and Forth interaction through email is often slow and this leads to crowded inboxes. Sometimes, professors are okay with creating class group chats on chat platforms like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, or Wechat. The problem is, usually social media is part of people's private life, and professors/students would prefer keeping their school life seperate from their private life.

### 1.2 Installation
